# GOGOES scripts
Collection of scripts and configuration files for turning incoming GOES-16
signal via SDR into png files that are then used to update a single png 
loaded into an image viewer that auto-refreshes. These scripts and conf files
depend heavily on goestools by Pieter Noordhuis:
https://pietern.github.io/goestools/
and the scripts, configuration files, and contrast curve and false color
